      <b>We Do Not Recommend Using Crypto for Your First Purchase</b>

      Paying with cryptocurrency is a great option for privacy and wider options, but if you're a <b>first-time buyer who has no experience with crypto</b>, it can introduce unnecessary complications and risks. Here's why:

      🔹 <b>Irreversible Payments</b> :: If you send funds to the wrong wallet address or blockchain network, your money is gone. Period. There is nothing we can do to intervene or help.

      💡 <b>What We Recommend Instead</b> :: If you're new to purchasing from gray-market vendors and crypto, it's easier to make your first purchase with a vendor that accepts credit cards, PayPal, or Alibaba (aka Alipay) payments. Once you're comfortable with the process, you can explore crypto for the wider options. 🚀

      If you do choose to use crypto, we recommend using a reputable exchange service like Exodus to purchase and swap your crypto. You can start learning about 🌐<a href='https://www.stairwaytogray.com/posts/crypto/crypto-101/'>how to use crypto here</a>

  # VENDOR SPREADSHEET VS VENDOR PROMO CHANNEL    
  Vendor_List_FAQ:
    message: |
      <b>📌 AAbout the Vendor Spreadsheet vs Promo Channel</b>

      We get this question a lot, so here's a quick overview:

      • The <b>Vendor Promo & Prices</b> channel is the most up-to-date place for current reps, promos, and contact info.  
      • The <b>Vendor Spreadsheet</b> is a supporting resource, but it isn't updated on a strict cadence and may lag behind the promo channel.  
      • Being on (or off) the spreadsheet is <b>not</b> an endorsement, quality ranking, or guarantee — it's just a community-maintained reference.

      If you don't see a vendor listed on the sheet, check the Vendor Promo & Prices channel and ask a mod or the community if you need context or experiences. 🙏

  ### AMO HAS STOPPED USING L FOR TIRZ AS OF NOVEMBER 2025 ###
  # Amo:
  #   message: |
