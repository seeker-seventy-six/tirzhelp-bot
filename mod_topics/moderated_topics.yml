      Thinking about ordering from QSC as a first-time buyer? TLDR: Please Don't.

      Here's what you need to know:

      • <b>Payment:</b> Only accepts crypto or bank transfers. Bank transfers might not always work, so be aware. If you're not already familiar with crypto, we advise not complicating your first purchase with this additional step.
      • <b>Customer Service:</b> Expect minimal communication. Don't expect them to confirm payment, provide tracking, or answer your questions promptly or at all. They will not provide hand holding through the purchase process.
      • <b>Packaging:</b> Items come unlabeled, and you'll need a decoder to understand the packing list.
      • <b>Delays:</b> Shipments can take more than a month to arrive, and support is slow to respond.

      QSC offers great prices, but their customer service is objectively the worst of the bunch and requires trust in the system. If you're new to the gray market, it's better to try a simpler, more reliable vendor first. Even seasoned buyers sometimes avoid QSC due to the hassle.

      Check out any of the other vendors for your first purchase in order to get familiar with the nuances and differences of ordering peptides from the gray market. Especially look for vendors who offer credit card options such as Alibaba or PayPal.

      <b>We Do Not Recommend Using Crypto for Your First Purchase</b>

      Paying with cryptocurrency is a great option for privacy and wider options, but if you're a <b>first-time buyer who has no experience with crypto</b>, it can introduce unnecessary complications and risks. Here's why:

      🔹 <b>Irreversible Payments</b> :: If you send funds to the wrong wallet address or blockchain network, your money is gone. Period. There is nothing we can do to intervene or help.

      💡 <b>What We Recommend Instead</b> :: If you're new to purchasing from gray-market vendors and crypto, it's easier to make your first purchase with a vendor that accepts credit cards, PayPal, or Alibaba (aka Alipay) payments. Once you're comfortable with the process, you can explore crypto for the wider options. 🚀

      If you do choose to use crypto, we recommend using a reputable exchange service like Exodus to purchase and swap your crypto. You can start learning about 🌐<a href='https://t.me/+1Msmy1Etat0wMjUx'>how to use crypto here</a>

      <b>I see you're asking about what L means?</b>
      
      👉 Amo uses <b>L</b> instead of <b>T</b> to denote Tirzepatide.

      • <b>L30</b> = Tirzepatide 300mg (10vials x 30mg)
      • <b>R10</b> = Retatrutide 100mg (10vials x 10mg)
      • <b>C10</b> = Cagrilintide 100mg (10vials x 10mg)
      • <b>S10</b> = Semaglutide 100mg (10vials x 10mg)

      <b>Kit:</b> A kit consists of 10 vials.
